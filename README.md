# HR-data-analysis-using-powerbi-and-sql-
The dataset used for analysis and visualization consists of HR (Human Resources) data containing over 22,000 rows from the years 2000 to 2020. The data was cleaned and analyzed using MySQL Workbench, a popular relational database management tool, inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. The cleaning process likely involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

After the data was cleaned and processed, it was then visualized using Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool that enables interactive and insightful data visualization. With Power BI, various types of charts, graphs, and dashboards can be created to represent the HR data visually. These visualizations would have allowed users to gain a better understanding of trends, patterns, and insights hidden within the HR dataset.
